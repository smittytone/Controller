# Controller #

Control Electric Imp Platform-based Internet of Things devices from your Apple Watch.

## Usage ##

The iPhone app provides a means to add devices — enter the device’s agent ID and a name — and sync the list of devices to the Watch app, which will provide an appropriate UI for each type of device. As such it is currently limited to the device types that I use, but the design is modular, so others can create UIs and WKInterfaceController objects of their own to personalise the app for their use.
